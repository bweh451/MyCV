## Desciption
This project is a website that I made that acts as my CV. I only used HTML and SCSS for this. There's nothing crazy, it's just a simple website that you can read through. I used CSS grid for the layout of the webpage and used google fonts for the fonts. I also used bootstrap icons for all the icons that acts as the bullets for the lists. I had a lot of fun with that.

## Installation
The installation is simple, all you have to do is to download all the files and open the index.html file in your web brower (you can do this by draging and dropping the file into one of your web browser's windows) read and enjoy.

## Usage
As stated before, this is just a simple website for my CV. Just scroll throug and have a read! I had did use media queries in CSS to make the website fully responsive so you can enjoy it on any screen !
